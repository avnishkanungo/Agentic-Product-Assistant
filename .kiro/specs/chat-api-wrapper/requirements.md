# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a FastAPI-based REST API wrapper around the existing terminal chat interface for the product assistant. The API will expose the chat functionality through HTTP endpoints, allowing web applications, mobile apps, or other services to interact with the product assistant programmatically. The implementation will maintain all existing functionality while providing a modern web API interface with proper error handling, request validation, and response formatting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the product assistant through HTTP API calls, so that I can integrate the assistant into web applications and other services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to `/chat` with a message THEN the system SHALL process the message using the existing ChatInterface and return a JSON response
2. WHEN a client sends a GET request to `/health` THEN the system SHALL return the health status of the assistant components
3. WHEN a client sends a GET request to `/status` THEN the system SHALL return detailed status information about the agent and its capabilities
4. IF the API server is running THEN it SHALL be accessible on a configurable host and port (default localhost:8000)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to send chat messages and receive structured responses, so that I can display the assistant's responses appropriately in my user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/chat` with valid JSON payload THEN the system SHALL return a structured response with content, success status, and metadata
2. WHEN the assistant calls a function during processing THEN the response SHALL include information about which function was called
3. WHEN an error occurs during processing THEN the response SHALL include error details and maintain a consistent JSON structure
4. IF the request payload is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 422 validation error with details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the API health and status, so that I can ensure the service is running properly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/health` THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 if all components are healthy or HTTP 503 if any component is unhealthy
2. WHEN a GET request is made to `/status` THEN the system SHALL return detailed information about agent readiness, available functions, and component status
3. WHEN the system encounters initialization errors THEN the health endpoint SHALL reflect the unhealthy state
4. IF any core component fails to initialize THEN the status endpoint SHALL provide specific error information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a client application, I want proper error handling and HTTP status codes, so that I can handle different scenarios appropriately and provide meaningful feedback to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API receives malformed JSON THEN it SHALL return HTTP 400 with error details
2. WHEN request validation fails THEN it SHALL return HTTP 422 with validation error details
3. WHEN internal server errors occur THEN it SHALL return HTTP 500 with appropriate error message
4. WHEN the assistant is not ready THEN chat requests SHALL return HTTP 503 with service unavailable message
5. IF rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 (future consideration)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can understand how to integrate with the service effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API server is running THEN it SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation at `/docs`
2. WHEN accessing `/redoc` THEN it SHALL provide alternative API documentation
3. WHEN viewing the documentation THEN it SHALL include request/response schemas, examples, and endpoint descriptions
4. IF authentication is added in the future THEN the documentation SHALL reflect the security requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want configurable server settings, so that I can deploy the API in different environments with appropriate configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the server THEN it SHALL read configuration from environment variables or command line arguments
2. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN it SHALL use sensible defaults (host=localhost, port=8000)
3. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN it SHALL log errors and use defaults or fail gracefully
4. IF CORS is needed THEN it SHALL be configurable for cross-origin requests

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a client application, I want session management capabilities, so that I can maintain conversation context across multiple API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client starts a new conversation THEN it SHALL receive a session ID
2. WHEN a client includes a session ID in requests THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context
3. WHEN a session expires or is invalid THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully
4. IF session storage becomes full THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cleanup strategies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to be production-ready, so that I can deploy it reliably in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL log startup information and component initialization status
2. WHEN requests are processed THEN it SHALL log appropriate information for monitoring and debugging
3. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL log detailed error information without exposing sensitive data in responses
4. IF the server is deployed THEN it SHALL handle graceful shutdown on termination signals
